h1me01: make a nice readme file about this project, this is where people can play/create and compete solving sudokus, they can use the solver to create their own sudokus or play against other players, the best players will be shown in the leaderboard etc: this is some other technical stuff: # SudokuSolver Commands

## Benchmarking
```bash
./build/sudokusolver bench sudoku_jsons/clones
```

## Building WASM (WSL)
```bash
cd ~/emsdk && source ./emsdk_env.sh
cd /mnt/c/users/semio/SudokuSolver/solver && make wasm
```

> **Note:** After updating WASM file in app, clear cache on firefox

## Memory Analysis

```bash
cd /mnt/c/users/semio/sudokusolver/solver
make
```

### Valgrind Check
```bash
valgrind ./sudokusolver ../sudoku_jsons/renban
```

### Memory Usage Analysis
```bash
valgrind --tool=massif ./sudokusolver ../sudoku_jsons/renban
ms_print massif.out.2417
```

## Web App Management

### Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations sudoku
python manage.py migrate
```

### Delete All Sudokus
```bash
python3 manage.py delete_sudokus --match-regex "."
```

### Import JSON Sudokus
```bash
source uvenv/bin/activate #u=ubuntu
python3 manage.py import_sudokus h1me ../sudoku_jsons/ --solver ../solver/SudokuSolver
``` dont include the memory analysis and valgrind and also say that you need to install the requirements using the requirements.txt

Workspace: Collecting workspace information# SudokuSolver

A comprehensive web-based Sudoku platform where players can solve puzzles, create their own challenges, and compete on global leaderboards. Built with Django and powered by a high-performance C++ solver compiled to WebAssembly.

## Features

🧩 **Play Sudokus** - Solve a variety of Sudoku variants and challenge types  
⚡ **Fast Solver** - High-performance C++ solver for instant puzzle validation  
🏆 **Leaderboards** - Compete with other players and climb the rankings  
🎨 **Puzzle Creation** - Use the solver to generate and validate your own puzzles  
📊 **Progress Tracking** - Save your progress and track your solving statistics  
🎯 **Multiple Variants** - Support for various Sudoku types including diagonal, cages, arrows, and more

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for building WebAssembly components)
- Emscripten SDK (for WASM compilation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SudokuSolver.git
   cd SudokuSolver
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   cd finnssudokusite
   python manage.py makemigrations sudoku
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Import sample puzzles** (optional)
   ```bash
   python manage.py import_sudokus your_username ../sudoku_jsons/ --solver ../solver/SudokuSolver
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Django Web App** (finnssudokusite/) - Main web application with user management and game interface
- **C++ Solver** (solver/) - High-performance Sudoku solver and generator
- **WebAssembly Interface** - Browser-compatible solver for real-time validation
- **JSON Puzzle Format** (sudoku_jsons/) - Standardized puzzle storage

## Development

### Building WebAssembly Solver

```bash
# Source Emscripten environment
cd ~/emsdk
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# Build WASM solver
cd /path/to/SudokuSolver/solver
make wasm
```

> **Note:** Clear browser cache after updating WASM files

### Benchmarking

Test solver performance on puzzle collections:
```bash
./build/sudokusolver bench sudoku_jsons
```

### Managing Puzzles

Delete all puzzles:
```bash
python manage.py delete_sudokus --match-regex "."
```
